/**
 * This protocol is an application level {@link TcpProtocol} that does nothing. Reading is terminated by the stream being closed
 * by the client.
 * When clients connect to a server using the EOF protocol, they write the message on the socket connection output stream.
 * To signal the end of the message, clients must signal the end of file (EOF) by closing the output stream and keeping the input stream open,
 * waiting for a response from the server. This behavior is known as half-close. Then, the server sends a response and closes its output stream and the whole socket connection.
 *
 * For TLS secured connections, use TLS 1.3 and JDK 11 as the half-close feature is not supported in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions.
 * The half-close feature triggers the close notification alert to prevent TLS truncation attacks. JDK 11 and newer versions support TLS 1.3.
 * Also, pooling profile is not compatible with `EofProtocol`.
